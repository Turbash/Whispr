## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository** and enter the directory.

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in this directory with your bot token:
   ```
   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```
   python bot.py
   ```

5. **Invite the bot to your Discord server** using the OAuth2 URL from the Discord Developer Portal.  
   Make sure to give it permissions to read/send messages, add reactions, and read message history.

6. **Set up the confession channel:**
   - As a server admin, type:
     ```
     !setup #your-confession-channel
     ```
     (Replace `#your-confession-channel` with the actual channel mention.)

7. **Get help:**
   - Type `!whisprhelp` in your server for usage instructions.

## Usage

- **Send a confession:**  
  DM the bot your message. If you're in multiple servers with confession channels, you'll get interactive buttons to choose which server to confess in.

- **Reply to a confession:**  
  DM the bot:
  ```
  reply #001 your reply message
  ```
  or
  ```
  reply 001 your reply message
  ```
  (Replace `001` with the confession number.)
  
  For multiple servers, you'll get buttons to choose which server to reply in.

- **Multi-server support:**  
  If you're in multiple servers with Whispr set up, the bot will show you interactive buttons to choose which server you want to confess or reply in.

- **Rate limiting:**  
  Users must wait 30 seconds between confessions per server (you can confess in different servers independently).

- **Help:**  
  Use `!whisprhelp` in your server for a summary of commands.

## Admin Commands

- `!setup #channel` â€” Set the confession channel for your server (admin only).
- `!whisprhelp` â€” Show help and usage instructions.
